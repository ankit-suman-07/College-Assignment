# Scroll Component Readme

## Overview
The `Scroll` component is a React component designed to display a list of colleges with various sorting and filtering options. It utilizes infinite scrolling to efficiently handle a large number of items.

## Components and Libraries Used
- React: The component is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- InfiniteScroll: It utilizes the `react-infinite-scroll-component` library for implementing infinite scrolling functionality.
- TopBar: The component includes a `TopBar` component for search and sorting options.
- Card: The `Card` component is used to display details of each college.

## File Structure
- `Scroll.js`: Contains the main logic for the `Scroll` component.
- `Scroll.css`: Stylesheet for the `Scroll` component.
- `Card/Card.js`: Defines the `Card` component for displaying college details.
- `TopBar/TopBar.js`: Defines the `TopBar` component for search and sorting options.
- `CollegeData.js`: Contains the data of colleges.

## Functionality
1. **Initial Rendering**: Upon initial rendering, the component displays the first 10 colleges from the data.
2. **Search**: Users can search for colleges by typing in the search input field provided by the `TopBar`. The component filters colleges based on the search query and updates the displayed list accordingly.
3. **Sorting**: Users can sort colleges by various criteria such as name, rank, course fee, CD review, and user review. Sorting options are provided in the `TopBar`. Sorting is implemented using state variables and effect hooks.
4. **Infinite Scrolling**: Infinite scrolling is implemented using the `InfiniteScroll` component. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the list, more colleges are fetched and added to the list.

## Code Explanation
- The code initializes state variables to manage the list of colleges, sorting options, and search query.
- It defines functions to handle search, sorting, and fetching more data.
- Effect hooks are used to trigger sorting and filtering whenever relevant state variables change.
- The JSX code defines the structure of the component, including the `TopBar`, table header, infinite scrolling functionality, and rendering of college cards.

## How to Use
To use the `Scroll` component in your React application:
1. Import the `Scroll` component.
2. Place the `Scroll` component in your desired location within your application.
3. Customize the component as needed by modifying the data, styling, or functionality.
